# Mental Health Classification Project

This project implements and compares three different machine learning approaches for mental health status classification based on text statements. The models evaluated are BERT (transformer-based), LSTM (recurrent neural network), and SVM (support vector machine) with TF-IDF features.

## Overview

The project analyzes text statements to classify mental health status using three different machine learning approaches:

- **BERT**: A pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned for sequence classification
- **LSTM**: A recurrent neural network with custom word embeddings
- **SVM**: A linear support vector machine with TF-IDF feature extraction

## Dataset

This project uses the **"Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health"** dataset from Kaggle, created by [suchintikasarkar](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health).

### Dataset Overview
- **Size**: 51,074 instances (30MB CSV file)
- **Source**: Kaggle - A comprehensive, curated collection of mental health statements
- **URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health

### Dataset Structure
The CSV file (`data.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `statement`: Text statements/comments related to mental health discussions
- `status`: Mental health status labels (target variable for classification)

### Data Source Composition
This dataset is a meticulously curated amalgamation of multiple publicly available mental health datasets from Kaggle, including:
- 3k Conversations Dataset for Chatbot
- Depression Reddit Cleaned
- Human Stress Prediction
- Mental Health Dataset Bipolar
- Reddit Mental Health Data
- Students Anxiety and Depression Dataset
- Suicidal Mental Health Dataset
- Suicidal Tweet Detection Dataset

### Data Preprocessing
The dataset is automatically split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets with a fixed random seed (42) for reproducibility across all three models.

**Key preprocessing steps:**
- **BERT**: Uses BERT tokenizer with truncation, padding, and max length of 128 tokens
- **LSTM**: Basic tokenization with regex `\b\w+\b`, lowercasing, vocabulary building from top 10,000 words
- **SVM**: Text cleaning (lowercasing, removing special characters), TF-IDF vectorization with max 10,000 features
- **Label encoding**: Consistent LabelEncoder across all models for target classes
- **Data splitting**: 70/30 train/validation split with random_state=42 for reproducibility

## Models

### 1. BERT (`bert.py`)
- Uses pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model
- Fine-tuned for 2 epochs with batch size 16

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn transformers torch
```

### Key Dependencies:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `scikit-learn`: SVM model and evaluation metrics
- `transformers`: BERT model and tokenizer
- `torch`: PyTorch for LSTM implementation

### 2. Download Dataset

1. Visit the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health)
2. Download the dataset (requires Kaggle account)
3. Extract the CSV file and place it in your project directory as `data.csv`
4. This is optional as the data used for training the models are present in the repository itself.

** Download using Kaggle API:**
```bash
# Install Kaggle CLI
pip install kaggle

# Download dataset (requires kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/)
kaggle datasets download -d suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health

# Extract the dataset
unzip sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health.zip
```

## Usage

### Training Individual Models

1. **Train BERT model:**
   ```bash
   python bert.py
   ```
   - Training time: 2 epochs (depends on hardware)
   - GPU recommended for faster training

2. **Train LSTM model:**
   ```bash
   python lstm.py
   ```
   - Training time: 20 epochs
   - Validates after each epoch
   - Custom vocabulary building included

3. **Train SVM model:**
   ```bash
   python svm.py
   ```
   - Fastest training time
   - Uses TF-IDF feature extraction
   - Good baseline for comparison

### Model Evaluation

Run the evaluation script to get detailed metrics:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This script calculates:
- Per-class metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Sensitivity, Specificity)
- Overall metrics (Accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, Macro/Micro/Weighted F1-scores)
- Confusion matrix analysis

The evaluation script automatically reads all prediction files from the `preds/` directory.

## Output Files

### Prediction Files (`preds/` directory)
Each model generates validation predictions in the `preds/` folder:
- `preds/val_predictions_bert.csv`: BERT model predictions
- `preds/val_predictions_lstm.csv`: LSTM model predictions  
- `preds/val_predictions_svm.csv`: SVM model predictions

Each CSV contains:
- `true_label`: Actual encoded labels (numerical, see below)  
- `predicted_label`: Model predictions (numerical, see below)

### Mental Health Numerical Categories

The dataset includes 7 mental health categories. All models use consistent label encoding:

| **Label Index** | **Mental Health Category** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **0** | **Anxiety** | Anxiety disorders and related symptoms |
| **1** | **Bipolar** | Bipolar disorder (manic-depressive episodes) |
| **2** | **Depression** | Depression and depressive episodes |
| **3** | **Normal** | Normal/healthy mental state |
| **4** | **Personality disorder** | Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) |
| **5** | **Stress** | Stress-related mental health conditions |
| **6** | **Suicidal** | Suicidal ideation and related thoughts |

**Note**: The numerical labels are consistent across all models (BERT, LSTM, SVM) due to alphabetical ordering by sklearn's LabelEncoder

### Saved Models (`results/` directory)
Trained models are saved in organized subdirectories:
- `results/BERT/`: BERT model files (Hugging Face format)
- `results/LSTM/lstm_model.pt`: PyTorch LSTM state dictionary
- `results/SVM/svm_model.joblib`: Scikit-learn SVM model
- `results/SVM/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib`: TF-IDF vectorizer for SVM

## Research Applications

This project demonstrates comparative analysis of machine learning approaches for mental health classification, with potential applications in:

- **Clinical Decision Support**: Assisting healthcare professionals in preliminary mental health screening
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Automated detection of mental health concerns in online platforms
- **Research and Analytics**: Large-scale analysis of mental health discourse patterns
- **Educational Tools**: Understanding public sentiment around mental health topics

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations

### Important Limitations
- **Not for Clinical Diagnosis**: This tool is for research purposes only and should not replace professional mental health evaluation
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Models may reflect biases present in training data and could lead to stigmatization
- **Class Imbalance**: Some mental health conditions remain underrepresented, affecting model performance
- **Text-based Only**: Analysis limited to linguistic patterns; does not consider clinical context or history
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Results may vary across different cultural and linguistic contexts

### Ethical Guidelines
As highlighted in the project research, deploying such models raises significant ethical questions:
- **Consent and Transparency**: Users should be informed before mental health classification
- **Data Privacy**: Strict privacy safeguards required for mental health-related text analysis  
- **Professional Oversight**: Models should only be deployed under supervision of public health professionals
- **Bias Auditing**: Regular evaluation for fairness and potential discrimination
- **Responsible Use**: Technology should support, not replace, human mental health professionals

## Notes

- All models use the same train/validation split (random_state=42) for fair comparison
- The project includes GPU support for BERT and LSTM models when available
- Models are saved for future inference and deployment
- Comprehensive logging and evaluation metrics are provided for model comparison
- For production use, consider additional validation with domain experts
- Regular model retraining recommended as language patterns evolve
